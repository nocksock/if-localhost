# if-localhost

A Web-Component that tells you when you're on localhost, so you no longer wonder why your changes have no effect.

## Usage

```
<script src="https://esm.sh/if-localhost" type="module"></script>
<if-localhost></if-localhost>
```

Adjust colors:

```
<if-localhost style="--border: lime; --text: magenta;"></if-localhost>
```

That's it.
